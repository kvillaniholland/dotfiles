VIM TODOS
- Color scheme
- Tab completion
- Current word highlight style
- Auto format server
- No current word highlight in Floaterm
- Cheatsheet sidebar??
- Annoying lag on raw keymap keys
test
- Is it still slowing down after being open for a while?
    - I think this might be Floaterm
    - ...or not...hard to repro because it only happens after some time.
    - Oh, maybe the clipboard history plugin? Although that should be buffer-independent
    - Disabling plugins:
        - Lualine: No effect
        - Git Blame: TBD
- Go through disabled settings in init.vim and remove any ones that I don't miss
- Shortcuts for trim trailing whitespace
