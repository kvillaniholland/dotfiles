VIM TODOS
- Color scheme
- Tab completion
- Current word highlight style
- Auto format server
- No current word highlight in Floaterm
- Cheatsheet sidebar??
- Annoying lag on raw keymap keys
test
- Is it still slowing down after being open for a while?
- Go through disabled settings in init.vim and remove any ones that I don't miss
