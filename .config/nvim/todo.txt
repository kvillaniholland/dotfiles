VIM TODOS
- Color scheme
- Tab completion
- Current word highlight style
- Auto format server
- No current word highlight in Floaterm
- Cheatsheet sidebar??
- Annoying lag on raw keymap keys
test
- Is it still slowing down after being open for a while?
    - Removed almost all plugins (and put `impatient` back) and it seems to be working better now.
    - Will re-enable as I feel like I need stuff, hopefully just one plugin at a time.
- Go through disabled settings in init.vim and remove any ones that I don't miss
- Shortcuts for trim trailing whitespace
