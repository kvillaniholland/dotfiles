## First time install

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oatmeaI/dotfiles/main/dotfiles/install.sh)"
```

## Updates

- `config pull` to download latest configs
- `dotinstall` to update dependencies, etc

## Notes
- The icon I use for Kitty is in the `dotfiles` directory.
- There are also a few wallpapers that I've collected, as well as the one I'm currently using.
