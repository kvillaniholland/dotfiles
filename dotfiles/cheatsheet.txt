- CTRL: Do yabai stuff in normal mode (nav is default)
- ALT: ALTer stuff (move windows around)
- SHIFT: interact with stacks
- CMD: interact with spaces

Normal Mode:
ctrl + m => force window focus
ctrl + [h/j/k/l] => navigate windows
ctrl + alt + [h/j/k/l] => stack windows
ctrl + shift + [j/k] => navigate stack
ctrl + cmd + [1/2/3/4] => navigate spaces

Mod Mode:
- [h/j/k/l]: navigate
- alt + [h/j/k/l]: move windows around
- cmd + [1/2/3/4]: move windows to space
- [a/d/f]: modify split

Nvim Only:
- alt + [h/j/k/l]: navigate vim windows (breaks paradigm...but consider as a separate world)

Todo:
- Make Yabai find focused window automatically (instead of ctrl-m)
- Correct hammerspoon hints
- setup cheatsheet?
- Ergonomics are bad - how to improve?
- Nvim -> annoying message on format and save autocommands if no LSP format, or file is not saved
- Make stack nav loop?
